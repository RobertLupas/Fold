**Describe your idea**
Describe the class you would like. How does it look, and what should the class be called? Or is it not a class? (If you don't know, classes are used by CSS and JavaScript to select and access specific elements. So literally, what the user should add to their existing code for the specific styling to be applied)

**Is it similar to an existing feature? If yes, which?**

**Additional context**
You can add any other context about your idea here. Ex.: Code for implementing it, measures, images, etc.
